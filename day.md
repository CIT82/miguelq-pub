## Afternoon

1. **Gather Tailgate Items**
   - Ribs from Costco (These are already cooked, just heat them up and eat, they are next to the rotisserie chicken)
   - [Bobby Salazar's Hot Green Salsa](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bobby-Salazar-s-Salsa-Verde-15-oz/189173733) - my favorite salsa, so good, but beware it's spicy.
   - [Jack Daniel's Sweet & Spicy BBQ Sauce](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jack-Daniel-s-Sweet-Spicy-BBQ-Sauce-19-5-oz/492451223) - Put this spicy sauce on the ribs and it's so good.
   - [Jack Daniel's Honey BBQ Sauce](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jack-Daniel-s-Honey-BBQ-Sauce-19-5-oz/434799106) - This flavor is for people that don't like spicy, it's great also.
2. **Go Visit My Parents**
3. **Get the Tailgate BBQ started for the Big Game**
